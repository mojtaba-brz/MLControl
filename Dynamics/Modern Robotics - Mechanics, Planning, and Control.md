# Foundations of Robot Motion

## Configuration Space
he configuration of a robot is a complete specification of  the position of every point of the robot. The minimum number n of real-valued coordinates needed to represent the configuration is the number of degrees of freedom (dof) of the robot. The n-dimensional space containing all possible  
configurations of the robot is called the configuration space (C-space). The configuration of a robot is represented by a point in its C-space.

### Degrees of Freedom of a Rigid Body

$$
Dof = \text{Sum of freedoms of the pints on the object} ~ - ~ \text{Sum of Independent constraints}
$$
Since our robots consist of rigid bodies, Equation above can be expressed as follows:

$$
Dof = \text{Sum of freedoms of the bodies} ~ - ~ \text{Sum of Independent constraints}
$$
