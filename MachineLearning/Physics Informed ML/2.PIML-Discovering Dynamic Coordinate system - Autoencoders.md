# Discover Dynamic Coordinates - Auto Encoders
![alt text](./ML%20Attachements/{A0AC6AF9-ED62-4554-AD67-B43764D7CD29}.png)

An auto-encoder is an architecture that reduce the input $x$ into a manifold $z$ so that it can be decoded into $\hat{x}$ so that it minimizes the error $LossFunction(x, \hat{x})$. In order to discover the dynamic of a system using this system we need to train this architecture to estimate the dynamic of input $x$ as it is show in the image above.

**Note :** You can also think of **SVD** as a super simple form of an auto-encoder.

## When to use?
* Partially known models - We can use ML to discover the whole model
* Nonlinear Dynamics - We are still struggling with nonlinearity
* High Dimensionality
