# Physics Informed Machine Learning
Physics-Informed Machine Learning is the intersection of ML and physics. It gives you the power to leverage your ML algorithms/systems using knowledge of physics, and it is also about modeling the physics that has not yet been written by humans. It's a powerful tool for a control and dynamic engineer for solving complex real world problems.

So There are two main approaches:
1. Enforce physics into ML : Less training effort and better generalization
2. Using ML to discover physics

### Workflow
1. Decide on problem. (What are we modeling?)
2. Curate data. (What data will inform the model?)
3. Design an architecture. (RNN, AutoEncoder, DMD, SINDy?)
4. Craft a loss function.
5. Optimization. (ADAM, SGD, ...)

**Note :** For this purpose, there is an Institute called **AI Institute in Dynamic Systems**.

There are three key aspects of physics that we usually enforce to our model:
1. Symmetry properties
2. Invariance
3. Conservation of energy 

## Decide on problem & Curating Training Data
**This is the most crucial aspect of a Physics-Informed Machine Learning problem.** It can be straightforward for some problems, such as modeling turbulence, or it can be ambiguous for many complex problems, like designing a better race car. For these ambiguous problems, we can start with an initial problem description and proceed through subsequent steps. As we observe the results of our efforts, we can revisit and refine the description if it does not align with our objectives. Thus, it is akin to other engineering problems and follows a scientific method.

### Why do we need an ML model?
1. To learn new physics
2. Capture expensive physics
    * Those physics we know but we can not simulate it easily
    * It can be used as a augmented model in our simulation
    * ML models are often automatically differentiable, So we can use this characteristic in classical optimization and design loops
3. Capturing multi-physics interactions
4. Update model with new data
    * Systems changes in time

### When not to use ML
1. When there is a good enough easy to simulate model
2. Astrology (ML is not a tool for *rammali*)

## Designing an Architecture

## Crafting a Loss Function

## Employing an Optimization Algorithm
